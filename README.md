# password-generator

## Description

This code creates a password generator that generates a random string of characters of at least 8 and up to 128. The series of prompts will stop when a number outside of these parameters is given twice. 

It allows the user to select the number of characters they would like to have in their password. They are then allowed to choose, through confirms, whether or not they would like to include numbers, lowercase, uppercase, and/or special characters in their password.

Once they complete the set of prompts, a randomly generated password is given.

## Installation

Access to running html, css, and javascript in a browser.

## Usage

To use this program, enter the amount of characters you would like your password to be (between 8 & 128 characters). 

Once the chosen amount is entered, the user will decide if they want numbers, lowercase, uppercase, and/or special characters through a pop-up. What they click will log as true or false.

This will then generate their password with the exact criteria they selected.
